#  JavaScript Duino Coin Miner 

This project provides a simple and efficient way to mine DuinoCoin cryptocurrency using JavaScript, HTML, and Web Workers for better user experience. This miner doesn't use wensocket connection and instead request and validates jobs by performing request to the network.

DuinoCoin is a lightweight, fast, and secure cryptocurrency designed for embedded systems such as Arduino boards. With this miner, you can harness the power of web browsers and utilize idle computing resources (pc, phones, consoles) to contribute to the DuinoCoin network.

## Getting Started
To get started with the DuinoCoin JavaScript Miner, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Configure your DuinoCoin username and mining key.
4. Click the "Start Mining" button to begin the mining process.

Please note that mining DuinoCoin using JavaScript and web browsers is a CPU-intensive task. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and consider the power and cooling limitations of your device.
